# This play leverages gathered host facts, passed in volume configuration and
# storage configuration, to check if the setup can be used for the required
# configuration. Further it operates on the passed in configuration to generate
# required json files, that can be used to configure bricks on each host, and
# also possibly gdeploy file(s) that can be used to create and start the gluster
# volume.
# One of the outputs of this play is storageconfgiuration.json that is consumed
# by the role prepare-bricks

# TODO: In the future another output would be volconf.gdeploy, that would be
# used by another appropriate play
