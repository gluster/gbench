# Benchmark test 0000-0001

This benchmark test uses IOZone [1] and smallfile [2] test suites to test various
performance charecteristics of Gluster.

The tests that are run using IOZone are, sequential write, sequential read,
random read/write.

The tests that are run using smallfile are, create, read, ls -l (listing)

## Pre-requisites
  - The environment variable CLIENTS must be set and contain a space separated
    list of IPs or hostnames [a]
  - The environment variable SERVERS must be set and contain a space separated
    list of IPs or hostnames [b]
  - The iozone config file must be stored in /root/clients.ioz.  It also must
    have 4 threads per client [c]
  - The smallfile application must be installed in /root/smallfile. If you have git installed this step will be performed during execution.
  - Passwordless SSH should be setup across the CLIENTS and SERVERS [d]
  - Provided sync-drop-caches.sh should be copied to /root/sync-drop-caches.sh
  
[a] To set the env. variable temporarily for the current shell and all the processes started from the current shell:

``` export CLIENTS=your-client-ip-01\ your-client-ip-02 #Space seperated list of IPs ```

[b] To set the env. variable temporarily for the current shell and all the processes started from the current shell:

``` export SERVERS=your-server-ip-01\ your-server-ip-02  #Space seperated list of IPs ```
  
[c] The configuration file contains a series of records that look like this: ``` hostname   directory   iozone-pathname ```

Where hostname is a host name or IP address of a test driver machine that iozone can use, directory is the pathname of a directory to use within that host, and iozone-pathname is the full pathname of the iozone executable to use on that host. Each record is a thread in iozone terminology, so as this test by default uses 4 threads, there should be 4 records per client mentioned in the CLIENTS environment variable. Be sure that every target host can resolve the hostname of host where the iozone command was run. All target hosts must permit password-less ssh access from the host running the command.

[d] To check the same, try ``` ssh root@yourclient_ip ```. 
If you're able to access root@yourclient_ip without the root password, you're all set.

## Arguments to the test tool

```
-s <size in KB>
        Record size for IOZone runs
        File size for the smallfile tests
        The same value is used for both series of tests

-f <files>
        Number of small files to create per smallfile test thread
        (default threads 8)
-n <numnber of samples>
        This setting runs a test multiple times (i.e collecting as many samples
        as requested), and provides an average across the runs. IOW, it enables
        collecting multiple test data, to avoid any noise in the test reflecting
        in the results.

Example: GlusterBench.py -s 64 -f 10000 -n 5 -v
```
