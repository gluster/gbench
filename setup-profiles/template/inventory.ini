# This is a template file to describe a setup profile for use
# with gbench.

# NOTES:
#  - As there maybe a need to hide host names and addresses, a
#    framework, as follows, has been provided to ease keeping
#    sensitive information a secret, at the same time ability
#    to provide the required public variable details in an
#    abstracted fashion.

# MUST HAVES:

#  1. We need the list of hosts provided for the gbench tests
#    split into 2 groups,
#    - servers
#      - List of hosts to be used as Gluster servers by gbench
#    - clients
#      - List of hosts to be used as Gluster clients by gbench
#
#  2. To define per host sensitive information each host has to
#     be within its own group named,
#    - server<n> or client<m>, where n:1..N m:1..M, and N/M are
#      the number of servers and clients respectively.

# This is an abstract template that hides the host names and can be submitted
# to the repositories. An internal copy of the same with the real host names
# can be kept, which would be used when actually running the setup and tests.
# The secret_inventory.ini is one such example of the real inventory.
#
# Similarly, the respective directories for each host group will contain
# the public (or 'all') information in the repositories, and
# secret files stashed away somewhere else.
