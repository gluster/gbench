# This is a YAML template, and hence the document starts with the above
# line '---'.

# NOTE: This template file describes all variables that are needed for a setup
# and mentions variables that *maybe* per host, and hence should go to the hosts
# public or secret variable file as needed.
#
# This is done so as to make this file a single point of reference for all
# variables that are needed for a provided setup.
#
# Variables with comments *MUST_BE_PUBLIC* should be public
# Variables with comments *NEEDED* should be specified
# Variables with comments *OPTIONAL* are optional

# ---- Connection specific variables ----
# *NEEDED*
# Below are ansible variables that define how to connect and talk to the
# hosts provided. For specializing these see [1]
#   - 'ansible_connection'
#   - 'ansible_user'

# ---- Gluster IP variable ----
# *NEEDED*
# Each host needs to have a 'glusteripv4' variable defined, in its host specific
# variable file

# ---- IB over IP configuration variables ----
# *OPTIONAL*
# If the hosts comes with Infiniband gear and you would like gbench to setup
# IPv4 over IB, then specify 'confibipv4addr' variable for corresponding hosts.
#   - further specify the following variables for the same,
#     - 'ipoib_device'
#     - 'ipoib_netmask'
#     - 'ipoib_use_gateway'
#     - 'ipoib_gateway'
# NOTE: typically, if this is specified the 'glusteripv4 address is the same
# as the 'confibipv4addr', this is not assumed or mandatory, just that using
# gbench to setup IP over IB for non-gluster use, seems an overuse of this tool.

# ---- Available devices for use variable ----
# *NEEDED*
# Each host that acts as a server, should have a list of devices that gbench
# can use to configure bricks. The variable is named 'devices'

# =============================================================================
# Template example starts here (feel free to clip out comments when defining

# ---- Connection specific variables ----
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_user: root

# ---- Gluster IP variable ----
# See individual host (client<n>/server<m>) file for definition of the same

# ---- IB over IP configuration variables ----
# These variables are defined in the 'all' variable group as they are common
# across all the hosts in this template. If each host has specific IPOverIB
# variables then those are defined in the server<m>/client<n> directories.
ipoib_device: ib0
ipoib_netmask: 255.255.255.0
ipoib_use_gateway: yes
ipoib_gateway: em1
